# Predicting Cryptocurrency Prices

## About

This is our Mini-Project for SC1015 (Introduction to Data Science and Artificial Intelligence) which aims to predict cryptocurrency prices of popular cryptocurrencies, scraping data from Yahoo-Finance

## Main Packages Used

- pandas_datareader
- fbprophet
- matplotlib
- tensorflow
- seaborn
- sklearn

## Datasets Used

- AAVE (AAVE)
- BinanceCoin (BNB)
- Bitcoin (BTC)
- ChainLink (LINK)
- Cardano (ADA)
- Ethereum (ETH)
- Solana (SOL)
- Tether (USDT)
- Uniswap (UNI1)

## Defining the Problem

- Are we able to accurately predict the future prices of the various cryptocurrencies?
- Which machine-learning model is more accurate in their prediction?

## Models Used

- Tensorflow LSTM
- FbProphet

## Conclusion

- Cryptocurrencies are generally predictable as long as there is no sudden changes that affects their prices significantly
- Prediction accuracy of both will be lower over a longer period of time
